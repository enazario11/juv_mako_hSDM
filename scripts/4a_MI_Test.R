#calculate O2 thresh -- as per Clarke et al., 2021
quantile(dat$DO100, probs = c(0, 0.10, 0.5, 0.75, 1), na.rm = T) #10 percentile is 0.05347627, used as threshold value (mol/m^3)
mean(dat$FL) #177.7 cm

W = 51807.63 #average mass in g for juv. makos as estimated by length-weight relationship. Used average FL of 177.7 cm (from study animals)
d = 0.700
K = 0.070 #adult numbers for K (VBGP) for california animals (fishbase.org)
j2 = 8000
j1 = 4500
OxyThresh = 0.05347

Linf = 321 #adult numbers for Linf FL for california animals (fishbase.org)
LwA = 0.01670 #juvenile numbers from fishbase (New Zealand mixed animals)
LwB = 2.847 #juvenile numbers from fishbase (New Zealand mixed animals)

#PO2 supply -> Do100 variable (mol/m3)
#W -> average mass in g for juv. makos as estimated by length-weight relationship. Used average FL of 177.7 (from study animals)
#d -> constant, Clarke et al. 2021
#K -> fishbase.org estimate for growth, von bertanlaffy growth parameter
#j1 -> constant, Clarke et al., 2021
#j2 -> constant, Clarke et al., 2021
#OxyThresh -> 10 percentile of DO100 observed. See code above for calculation. AS done in Clarke et al., 2021
#Tpref -> median SST across the species distribution (Clarke et al., 2021). See code above for calculation. Following their protocol, calculated the median sst in C
#T -> SST variable from data table (K)
#Linf-> 321 cm is the asymptotic Length estimated by the VBGP (Linf) for adult sharks in CA
#LwA -> additional value needed to estimate asymptotic weight. Values were pulled from mixed individuals from New Zealand. No West Coast USA data available. 
#lwB -> additional value needed to estimate asymptotic weight. Values were pulled from mixed individuals from New Zealand. No West Coast USA data available. 


### oxy demand function ####
#Function to estimate the oxygen demand of a species at a temperature (rTempNewST) given its temperature preference and oxygen threshold.
#Tpref: species temperature preference
#OxyThresh: species oxygen threshold
#rTempNewST: Environmental temperature
