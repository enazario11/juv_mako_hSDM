Below are links to the pages containing different exploratory analyses for the juvenile mako shark hybrid-SDM work.

[See here](diet_explore_revise.html) for the initial diet data exploration (CMEM domain).

[See here](merc_valid3.html) for the Mercator BIORYS4 and GLORYS4 data product validation work.

[See here](covar_explore_psat_spot_new.html) for the figures depicting the covariate exploration (CRW PA) across depth layers (0m, 60m, 250m)

[See here](covar_explore_psat_spot_back.html) for the figures depicting the covariate exploration (Background PA) across depth layers (0m, 60m, 250m)

[See here](brt_explore_psat__spot_new.html) for the initial BRT output exploration. This includes pseudo absences generated with correlated random walks and environmental data at a daily, seasonal, and annual resolution.

[See here](brt_explore_psat_spot_back.html) for the initial BRT output exploration. This includes pseudo absences generated with background sampling and environmental data at a daily, seasonal, and annual resolution.

[See here](brt_prelim_results.html) for the preliminary brt results across the base and final models for both crw and background PA approaches. Drafted figures include HSI maps and difference maps, AGI and AGIcrit maps, predictor relative influence donut and radar plots, and comparisons of model performance metrics across model types.
